# TF2CPorts
## Ports of popular TF2 plugins to the TF2 Classic sourcemod.

## Includes:
- Roll the Dice
- Class Warfare
- Civilian Only
- VS. Saxton Hale (abandoned, run FF2 instead)
- Freak Fortress 2
- TF2Ware (included config disables a few broken microgames)
- NativeVotes (fixes a crash on sourcemods)
- Instant Respawn
These **require** https://github.com/Scags/TF2Classic-Tools to load, but are stripped of gamedata
This should make them work across game updates.

RTD, Class Warfare, and Civilian Only also feature proper 4 team support.

The TF2Ware resources are included because these are hard to find (original plugin download is broken). For the other plugins, you can go
to their original pages to download the resources:
